            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15690:7"/>High God, whereunto wee had not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øafed an≈øwere, but that wee were per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, our ≈øilence would haue been a meanes of cau≈øing thee to flatter thy ≈øelfe ≈øo much the more, el≈øe had <hi>Wee</hi> neglected thee like an Arch-enemy of God, as thou art. <hi>Wee</hi> haue therefore thought fit in ≈øome ≈øort to regard the Saluation of thy ≈øoule, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thee to know, that thou art no other then a meere man, in thy per≈øon more weake then many of thy followers; which ≈øhould cau≈øe thee to remember, that if it had not plea≈øed God to ingraue in the front of ≈øuch as rule, a kinde of awfull Maie≈øtie, whereby their ≈øubiects are kept in obedience; the good by reward, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and peruer≈øe by rigorous Lawes, and both the one and the other by Authoritie; it were impo≈ø≈øible they ≈øhould continue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent aboue others. Thou then, who in thy ≈øelfe art but as other men, mu≈øt know, that there is a Supreme Power of more might then thine, which doth vphold thy e≈øtate, cau≈øing thee to bee re≈øpected by thy followers. This power proceeds from God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15690:7"/>mo≈øt Good, mo≈øt Iu≈øt, mo≈øt Mighty, who pre≈ørueth it ≈øo long as Princes humble them≈øelues before him; but if they ≈øuffer them≈øelues to bee tran≈øported with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption, and pride, he ea≈øily abateth, and corrects their fury. I will offer no other example to thy con≈øideration, then that of <hi>Baiazet</hi> the fir≈øt, one of thy Predece≈ø≈øors, who thinking to ≈øcale Heauen with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie (which in the iudgement of Man was vnre≈øi≈øtable, but in Gods ≈øight mo≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible) liued to ≈øee him≈øelfe vanqui≈øhed, taken, and impri≈øoned, coopt vp in an iron cage, (wherein hee vvas in triumph drawne after the victorious Conquerour, ≈øeruing him for no better then a foot≈øtoole) and hauing no other food, then ≈øuch as was ca≈øt him (like a Dogge) from his Table.</p>
            <p>Thinke then with thy ≈øelfe, that hee that vvas ≈øo great, ≈øo pui≈ø≈øant, and ≈øo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, may haply by right of Succe≈øsion haue left vnto thee (as beeing de≈øcended from him) the like, or wor≈øe fortune, if thou ≈øhalt dare to continue thy bla≈øphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt GOD, and his Beloued Sonne <hi>Ie≈øus
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15690:8"/>Chri≈øt Crucified.</hi> Thou doe≈øt mi≈øtake in thinking to lay an a≈øper≈øion vpon vs, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching vnto vs the Cro≈ø≈øe. For <hi>Wee</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it Our chiefe≈øt honour, and glory; by vertue vvhereof, as the Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantine</hi> quelled his enemies, Wee hope, and a≈ø≈øured our ≈øelues to bee defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt thy Fury. Thy proud, and thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring words di≈ømay vs not, our courage is more Ma≈øculine and generous, then ≈øo to bee out-braued. For know, that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not thy threats, but vvith iu≈øt ≈øcorne tread vpon thy pride, and laugh at thy idle terrours, and in ≈øtead of thanking thee for aduerti≈øing vs before thy comming, We bid thee come when thou wilt, thou ≈øhalt bee receiued contrary to thy expectation. Wee haue ≈øteepe Mountaines, and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Rockes that ≈øhall barre thee from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into our Lands. Thou ≈øhalt finde our Cities, and Ca≈øtles well furni≈øhed with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, our Canons mouthes breathing fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fires, our courages inuincible, our blades eager and ≈øharpe, our bodies, as our mindes, prepared to ≈øu≈øtaine the violence of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15690:8"/>all ≈øea≈øons, our hearts promi≈øing nothing but victory. And to dazell thine eyes, the glorious Standard of the ble≈ø≈øed <hi>Cro≈ø≈øe</hi> ≈øhall goe before vs; but aboue all, the <hi>Crucified Son</hi> of the mo≈øt High God ≈øhal cau≈øe his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to conduct vs, and giue vs the victory; He it is ≈øhall bee our Leader, vnder who≈øe protection wee will not feare to braue thee at thy Gates. Thy mi≈øcreant troupes ≈øhall be troden vnderfoote, and their bellies tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on, and by a happy victory (if thou chance to e≈øcape our conquering Arme) thou ≈øhalt finde thy ≈øelfe pur≈øued vnto the mo≈øt ≈øecret Dens of thy abominable <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio;</hi> thou ≈øhalt ≈øee thy <hi>Mo≈øques</hi> laid leuell with the ground, thy <hi>Muphty,</hi> and other the execrable Prie≈øts of thy perfidious <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> made Gally-≈ølaues; all tho≈øe traiterous run-a-gates whom thou doe≈øt harbor, ≈øhalt thou ≈øee put to exqui≈øite torments; of all which be mo≈øt a≈ø≈øured. And then ≈øhall bee ≈øet free all tho≈øe poore and mi≈øerable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, who now lie groning vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of thy Tyrannous yoake, who≈øe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cryes being mounted to Heauen, haue
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15690:9"/>iu≈øtly excited the vengeance of God vpon thee, who hath permitted thee to ri≈øe to this height of pride, that thy ruine &amp; de≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may bee the more exemplar vnto after-ages. To conclude, thou ≈øhalt ≈øee the ≈øeruice of <hi>God</hi> re-e≈øtabli≈øhed in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>A≈øia,</hi> which thou doe≈øt now vniu≈øtly v≈øurpe. But if it happen thee to end thy mi≈øerable life in Battell, (which we hope <hi>God</hi> will grant) be confident, that all the fore≈øaid vengeance ≈øhall en≈øue vpon thy death; And whiles thy wretched Soule lies broiling in the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe flames of Hell, wee will lift vp our cheerefull voices, and, for the victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ouer thee and thine, ≈øing prai≈øes vnto our <hi>God:</hi> to whom be all glory for euer.</p>
            <p>Know then, O Infidell, that we feare thee not at all, and if thou bee≈øt not wilfully bent to runne headlong vnto thy owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, be adui≈øed; content, and containe thy ≈øelfe within tho≈øe bounds thou doe≈øt at this pre≈øent v≈øurpe, and if thou ha≈øt any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe at al that thy thrice reuerenced Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> could tell a truth, or foretell fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euents, then call to minde, that of tho≈øe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15690:9"/>thou≈øand yeeres which hee pre≈øcribed for the continuing of thy Sect, there remaine not aboue ≈øixe or ≈øeuen yeeres. This then is the time that the yet vn≈øheathed Sword of the Chri≈øtians affords for thy amendment, that thou mighte≈øt come to the knowledge of the alone True GOD, to wor≈øhip him in his Sonne IESVS CHRIST, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto we once more exhort thee, omitting all other ≈øalutation, and commendation.</p>
